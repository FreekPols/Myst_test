# exercise

This is an exercise which will be rendered as a note admonition in a PDF! 

```{exercise} Name exercise
:label: exercise_1

An exercise...
4 + 2 = ...
```

```{solution} exercise_1
:label: solution_1
6
```

This should be a link to the exercise ->  [exercise](#exercise_1) <-

and this should be a link to the solution ->  [solution](#solution_1) <-

while the admonition looks like this

:::{note}
:label: test_note
a note admonition
:::

and this should be a link to the note -> [testnote](#test_note) <-. The link does not come to the pdf as of now, so we do not have to worry about this for the exerciss + solution.

```{intermezzo} No name
Here are some side dishes.
```
